# piStats
A Bash script that uses the Raspberry Pi's built-in `vcgencmd` utility to display a pleasing summary of system stats in one place.
 - CPU temperature
 - CPU PWM Fan rpm (only Pi 5)
 - CPU, GPU (`core`, `h264`, `hevc`, `isp`, `v3d`), and SD card reader clock speeds
 - CPU and RAM (`mem_core`, `mem_io`, `mem_phy`) voltages
 - SOC (`uncached`) voltage (only for Pi 4 & Pi 5)
 - CPU and GPU memory split
 - Throttle status alerts
 - PMIC bit status (only for Pi 5)

As the Raspberry Pi is a low-power machine to begin with (especially its earlier iterations), the script has been optimized to use Bash's built-in functions wherever possible to prevent relatively costly external commands (e.g. `bc`) from skewing results.

The original script has been improved and expanded in features and compatibility.
It should work on all Raspberry Pi up to the actual latest, Pi 5.

## Usage
Running the script without any command-line arguments will display a simple overview of the temperature (Summary mode), CPU and GPU (`core` only) clock speeds, and CPU voltageâ€”i.e. what most people are probably interested in.

- `-c`: continuous mode switch, which will print the CPU temperature, clock speed, and voltage in columns every few seconds. This can be helpful in monitoring the performance of an overclock, for example. The default delay, in seconds, may be changed through the `DELAY` variable at the top of the script or specified via the `-d` flag.

- `-d <NN>`: continuous mode, delay in seconds between updates (default 8 seconds).

- `-v`: enables verbosity, which will show additional information (namely, the other GPU clock speeds, SD card reader clock speed, RAM voltages) in Summary mode.

- `-r`: toggle to show ARM Core voltage (vcore)
- `-o`: toggle to SOC voltage (vsoc)
- `-q`: toggle to kernel cpufreq driver core clocks (requested/reported)
- `-t`: toggle to SOC temperature
- `-f`: toggle to Fan rpm speed
- `-p`: toggle to show ARM Core power consumption (pcore)
- `-j`: toggle to show Ring Oscillator 1 in continuous mode
- `-k`: toggle to show Ring Oscillator 2 in continuous mode
- `-l`: toggle to show Ring Oscillator 3 in continuous mode
- `-b`: toggle to show Ring Oscillators in Summary mode
- `-h`: prints a short summary of the command-line switches

The default values and toggle states can be modified directly inside the script; 0 to disable, 1 to enable.

Some options are hidden and can be toggled only inside the script: 

- `PMIC`: toggle all queries to the PMIC 

- `PMIC_VOLTAGES`: toggle show PMIC voltage in Summary mode

- `GPU_SPLIT`: toggle show GPU split in Summary mode
